<h1><i>Section 1</i></h1>
    <font color ='#FF0000'>The news that a wealthy young gentleman named Charles Bingley</font> has rented the manor known as Netherfield Park
    causes a great stir in the neighboring village of Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household.
    <p>The Bennets have five unmarried daughters, and Mrs. Bennet, a foolish and fussy gossip,
    is the sort who agrees with the novel’s opening words: “It is a truth universally acknowledged,
        that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.”</p>
    <p>She sees Bingley’s arrival as an opportunity for one of the girls to obtain a wealthy spouse,
    and she therefore insists that her husband call on the new arrival immediately.
    Mr. Bennet torments his family by pretending to have no interest in doing so,
        but he eventually meets with Mr. Bingley without their knowing.</p>
    <p>When he reveals to Mrs. Bennet and his daughters that he has made their new neighbor’s acquaintance,
        they are overjoyed and excited.</p>
